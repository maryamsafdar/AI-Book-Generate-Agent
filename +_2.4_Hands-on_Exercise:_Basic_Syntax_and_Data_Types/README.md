<p><strong>Chapter 2.4: Hands-on Exercise - Basic Syntax and Data Types</strong></p>

<p>In this chapter, we will delve into the world of programming by exploring the basic syntax and data types of a programming language. We will use Python as our language of choice for this exercise, but the concepts learned here can be applied to other languages as well.</p>

<p><strong>2.4.1 Introduction to Basic Syntax</strong></p>

<p>Before we dive into the hands-on exercise, let's take a brief look at the basic syntax of Python. Python's syntax is simple and easy to read, making it an ideal language for beginners.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Indentation</strong>: Python uses indentation to denote block-level structure. This means that you need to indent your code using four spaces to define a block of code.</li>
<li><strong>Variables</strong>: In Python, you can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=). For example: <code>x = 5</code> assigns the value 5 to the variable x.</li>
<li><strong>Print Function</strong>: The print function is used to output text or values to the screen. For example: <code>print("Hello, World!")</code> prints the string "Hello, World!" to the screen.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.4.2 Basic Data Types</strong></p>

<p>Python has several basic data types that are used to store and manipulate data. These data types include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Integers</strong>: Integers are whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero. For example: <code>x = 5</code> assigns the integer value 5 to the variable x.</li>
<li><strong>Floats</strong>: Floats are decimal numbers. For example: <code>x = 3.14</code> assigns the float value 3.14 to the variable x.</li>
<li><strong>Strings</strong>: Strings are sequences of characters. For example: <code>x = "Hello, World!"</code> assigns the string value "Hello, World!" to the variable x.</li>
<li><strong>Boolean</strong>: Boolean values are true or false values. For example: <code>x = True</code> assigns the boolean value True to the variable x.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.4.3 Hands-on Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Now that we have covered the basic syntax and data types of Python, let's put our knowledge to the test with a hands-on exercise.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 1: Variables and Data Types</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Open a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and create a new file called <code>exercise1.py</code>.</li>
<li>In the file, assign the following values to variables:
<ul>
<li><code>x = 5</code> (integer)</li>
<li><code>y = 3.14</code> (float)</li>
<li><code>name = "John Doe"</code> (string)</li>
<li><code>isAdmin = True</code> (boolean)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use the print function to output the values of each variable to the screen.</li>
<li>Run the program by saving the file and executing it in the terminal or command prompt.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Example Code</strong>
```python</p>

<h1>Assign values to variables</h1>

<p>x = 5
y = 3.14
name = "John Doe"
isAdmin = True</p>

<h1>Print values to the screen</h1>

<p>print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)
print("name =", name)
print("isAdmin =", isAdmin)
```
<strong>Exercise 2: Basic Operations</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Open a new file called <code>exercise2.py</code>.</li>
<li>In the file, perform the following operations:
<ul>
<li>Add 2 to the value of x</li>
<li>Multiply the value of y by 2</li>
<li>Concatenate the string "Hello, " with the value of name</li>
<li>Use the not operator to negate the value of isAdmin</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use the print function to output the results of each operation to the screen.</li>
<li>Run the program by saving the file and executing it in the terminal or command prompt.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Example Code</strong>
```python</p>

<h1>Assign values to variables</h1>

<p>x = 5
y = 3.14
name = "John Doe"
isAdmin = True</p>

<h1>Perform operations</h1>

<p>x += 2
y *= 2
greeting = "Hello, " + name
isAdmin = not isAdmin</p>

<h1>Print results to the screen</h1>

<p>print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)
print("greeting =", greeting)
print("isAdmin =", isAdmin)
```
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In this chapter, we have covered the basic syntax and data types of Python. We have also performed hands-on exercises to reinforce our understanding of these concepts. By completing these exercises, you should now have a solid foundation in the basics of programming and be ready to move on to more advanced topics.</p>

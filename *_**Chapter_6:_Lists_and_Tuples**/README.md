<p><strong>Chapter 6: Lists and Tuples</strong></p>

<p><strong>6.1 Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In the world of programming, data structures play a vital role in storing and manipulating data. Among the various data structures available in Python, lists and tuples are two of the most commonly used. In this chapter, we will delve into the world of lists and tuples, exploring their characteristics, creation methods, and various operations that can be performed on them.</p>

<p><strong>6.2 Lists</strong></p>

<p>A list in Python is a collection of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists. Lists are denoted by square brackets <code>[]</code> and are mutable, meaning they can be modified after creation.</p>

<p><strong>6.2.1 Creating Lists</strong></p>

<p>There are several ways to create a list in Python:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using square brackets <code>[]</code>: This is the most common way to create a list. You can create an empty list by using <code>[]</code> or create a list with elements by separating them with commas.</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Create an empty list</h1></li>
</ul>

<p>my_list = []</p>

<h1>Create a list with elements</h1>

<p>my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using the <code>list()</code> function: This function can be used to create a list from other data structures such as tuples, sets, and dictionaries.</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Create a list from a tuple</h1></li>
</ul>

<p>my<em>tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
my</em>list = list(my_tuple)</p>

<h1>Create a list from a set</h1>

<p>my<em>set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my</em>list = list(my_set)
```</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using list comprehension: This is a concise way to create a list by performing an operation on each item in an existing list or other iterable.</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 5</h1></li>
</ul>

<p>my_list = [i**2 for i in range(1, 6)]
```</p>

<p><strong>6.2.2 List Operations</strong></p>

<p>Lists support various operations such as indexing, slicing, concatenation, and modification.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Indexing: Lists are indexed, meaning each element has a unique index that can be used to access it. Indexing starts from 0, and negative indices can be used to access elements from the end of the list.</p>

<p><code>python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_list[-1])  # Output: 5
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Slicing: Slicing allows you to extract a subset of elements from a list. You can specify the start and end indices, and the step size.</p>

<p><code>python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[1:3])  # Output: [2, 3]
print(my_list[1:5:2])  # Output: [2, 4]
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Concatenation: You can concatenate two or more lists using the <code>+</code> operator.</p>

<p><code>python
my_list1 = [1, 2, 3]
my_list2 = [4, 5, 6]
print(my_list1 + my_list2)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Modification: Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify them after creation. You can use indexing to modify individual elements or use methods such as <code>append()</code>, <code>insert()</code>, and <code>remove()</code> to modify the list.</p>

<p>```python
my<em>list = [1, 2, 3]
my</em>list[0] = 10
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3]</p></li>
</ul>

<p>my<em>list.append(4)
print(my</em>list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4]</p>

<p>my<em>list.insert(1, 20)
print(my</em>list)  # Output: [10, 20, 2, 3, 4]</p>

<p>my<em>list.remove(2)
print(my</em>list)  # Output: [10, 20, 3, 4]
```</p>

<p><strong>6.3 Tuples</strong></p>

<p>A tuple in Python is a collection of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and other tuples. Tuples are denoted by parentheses <code>()</code> and are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified after creation.</p>

<p><strong>6.3.1 Creating Tuples</strong></p>

<p>There are several ways to create a tuple in Python:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using parentheses <code>()</code>: This is the most common way to create a tuple. You can create an empty tuple by using <code>()</code> or create a tuple with elements by separating them with commas.</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Create an empty tuple</h1></li>
</ul>

<p>my_tuple = ()</p>

<h1>Create a tuple with elements</h1>

<p>my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using the <code>tuple()</code> function: This function can be used to create a tuple from other data structures such as lists, sets, and dictionaries.</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Create a tuple from a list</h1></li>
</ul>

<p>my<em>list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my</em>tuple = tuple(my_list)</p>

<h1>Create a tuple from a set</h1>

<p>my<em>set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my</em>tuple = tuple(my_set)
```</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using tuple packing: This is a concise way to create a tuple by assigning values to multiple variables.</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Create a tuple using tuple packing</h1></li>
</ul>

<p>my_tuple = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```</p>

<p><strong>6.3.2 Tuple Operations</strong></p>

<p>Tuples support various operations such as indexing, slicing, and concatenation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Indexing: Tuples are indexed, meaning each element has a unique index that can be used to access it. Indexing starts from 0, and negative indices can be used to access elements from the end of the tuple.</p>

<p><code>python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_tuple[-1])  # Output: 5
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Slicing: Slicing allows you to extract a subset of elements from a tuple. You can specify the start and end indices, and the step size.</p>

<p><code>python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple[1:3])  # Output: (2, 3)
print(my_tuple[1:5:2])  # Output: (2, 4)
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Concatenation: You can concatenate two or more tuples using the <code>+</code> operator.</p>

<p><code>python
my_tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
my_tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
print(my_tuple1 + my_tuple2)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chapter 2.2: Variables and Data Types</strong></p>

<p>In programming, a variable is a storage location that holds a value. Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. In this chapter, we will discuss the concept of variables and data types in programming.</p>

<p><strong>2.2.1 What are Variables?</strong></p>

<p>A variable is a name given to a storage location that holds a value. Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. Think of a variable as a labeled box where you can store a value. You can then use the label to refer to the value stored in the box.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you want to store the value of a person's age in a program. You can create a variable called <code>age</code> and assign it the value <code>25</code>. Then, you can use the variable <code>age</code> to refer to the value <code>25</code> in your program.</p>

<p><strong>2.2.2 Declaring Variables</strong></p>

<p>To use a variable in a program, you must first declare it. Declaring a variable means specifying its name and data type. The syntax for declaring a variable varies depending on the programming language you are using.</p>

<p>For example, in Java, you can declare a variable called <code>age</code> with the data type <code>int</code> as follows:</p>

<p><code>java
int age;
</code></p>

<p>In Python, you can declare a variable called <code>age</code> without specifying its data type as follows:</p>

<p><code>python
age = 25
</code></p>

<p><strong>2.2.3 Assigning Values to Variables</strong></p>

<p>Once you have declared a variable, you can assign a value to it. The syntax for assigning a value to a variable varies depending on the programming language you are using.</p>

<p>For example, in Java, you can assign the value <code>25</code> to the variable <code>age</code> as follows:</p>

<p><code>java
age = 25;
</code></p>

<p>In Python, you can assign the value <code>25</code> to the variable <code>age</code> as follows:</p>

<p><code>python
age = 25
</code></p>

<p><strong>2.2.4 Data Types</strong></p>

<p>A data type is a classification of data based on its format and the operations that can be performed on it. There are several data types that are commonly used in programming, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Integers</strong>: Integers are whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero. Examples of integers include <code>1</code>, <code>-1</code>, and <code>0</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Floating-Point Numbers</strong>: Floating-point numbers are numbers that have a fractional part. Examples of floating-point numbers include <code>3.14</code> and <code>-0.5</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Characters</strong>: Characters are single symbols, such as letters, digits, and special characters. Examples of characters include <code>'a'</code>, <code>'1'</code>, and <code>'!'</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Strings</strong>: Strings are sequences of characters. Examples of strings include <code>"hello"</code>, <code>"goodbye"</code>, and <code>"hello world!"</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Boolean</strong>: Boolean values are true or false values. Examples of boolean values include <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.2.5 Primitive Data Types</strong></p>

<p>Primitive data types are the basic data types that are built into a programming language. The primitive data types vary depending on the programming language you are using.</p>

<p>For example, in Java, the primitive data types include:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>byte</code>: an 8-bit signed integer</li>
<li><code>short</code>: a 16-bit signed integer</li>
<li><code>int</code>: a 32-bit signed integer</li>
<li><code>long</code>: a 64-bit signed integer</li>
<li><code>float</code>: a 32-bit floating-point number</li>
<li><code>double</code>: a 64-bit floating-point number</li>
<li><code>char</code>: a 16-bit unsigned character</li>
<li><code>boolean</code>: a true or false value</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.2.6 Reference Data Types</strong></p>

<p>Reference data types are data types that store a reference to a value rather than the value itself. Examples of reference data types include arrays, lists, and objects.</p>

<p>For example, in Java, an array is a reference data type that stores a reference to a collection of values. You can declare an array of integers as follows:</p>

<p><code>java
int[] scores;
</code></p>

<p>You can then assign a value to the array as follows:</p>

<p><code>java
scores = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
</code></p>

<p><strong>2.2.7 Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In this chapter, we discussed the concept of variables and data types in programming. We learned how to declare variables, assign values to variables, and use data types to classify data. We also learned about primitive data types and reference data types.</p>

<p>Understanding variables and data types is essential for programming. By using variables and data types effectively, you can write efficient and effective code that solves real-world problems.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Declare a variable called <code>name</code> with the data type <code>String</code>.</li>
<li>Assign the value <code>"John Doe"</code> to the variable <code>name</code>.</li>
<li>Declare a variable called <code>age</code> with the data type <code>int</code>.</li>
<li>Assign the value <code>25</code> to the variable <code>age</code>.</li>
<li>Print the values of the variables <code>name</code> and <code>age</code> to the console.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p><code>java
String name = "John Doe";
int age = 25;
System.out.println("Name: " + name);
System.out.println("Age: " + age);
</code></p>

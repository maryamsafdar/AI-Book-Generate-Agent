<p><strong>Chapter 2: Basic Syntax and Data Types</strong></p>

<p><strong>2.1 Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In the previous chapter, we introduced the basics of programming and the importance of understanding the syntax and data types of a programming language. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the basic syntax and data types of a programming language, using a general programming language as a reference. Understanding the syntax and data types is crucial for writing efficient and effective code.</p>

<p><strong>2.2 Basic Syntax</strong></p>

<p>The syntax of a programming language refers to the set of rules that govern the structure of the language. It defines how the language elements, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and symbols, are combined to form valid statements and expressions. The basic syntax of a programming language typically includes the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>: These are reserved words that have special meanings in the language. Examples of keywords include <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>class</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Identifiers</strong>: These are names given to variables, functions, and other language elements. Identifiers typically consist of letters, digits, and underscores.</li>
<li><strong>Literals</strong>: These are values that are represented directly in the code, such as numbers, strings, and booleans.</li>
<li><strong>Symbols</strong>: These are special characters that are used to represent operators, such as <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic syntax of a programming language also defines the structure of statements and expressions. A statement is a complete unit of code that performs a specific action, such as assigning a value to a variable or printing a message to the console. An expression is a combination of values, operators, and functions that evaluates to a single value.</p>

<p><strong>2.3 Data Types</strong></p>

<p>A data type is a classification of data based on its format, size, and set of values it can hold. Data types are used to declare variables, function parameters, and return types. The basic data types in a programming language typically include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Integers</strong>: These are whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero. Examples of integers include <code>1</code>, <code>-5</code>, and <code>0</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Floating-point numbers</strong>: These are numbers that have a fractional part. Examples of floating-point numbers include <code>3.14</code> and <code>-0.5</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Characters</strong>: These are single characters, such as letters, digits, and special characters. Examples of characters include <code>'a'</code> and <code>'5'</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Strings</strong>: These are sequences of characters, such as words, phrases, and sentences. Examples of strings include <code>"hello"</code> and <code>"goodbye"</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Booleans</strong>: These are values that can be either true or false. Examples of booleans include <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Arrays</strong>: These are collections of values of the same data type stored in a single variable. Examples of arrays include <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> and <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.4 Variables and Operators</strong></p>

<p>Variables are used to store values in a program. A variable is declared by specifying its data type and name. For example, <code>int x;</code> declares a variable <code>x</code> of type <code>int</code>. Variables can be assigned values using the assignment operator <code>=</code>. For example, <code>x = 5;</code> assigns the value <code>5</code> to the variable <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>Operators are used to perform operations on values. The basic operators in a programming language typically include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arithmetic operators</strong>: These are used to perform arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Examples of arithmetic operators include <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison operators</strong>: These are used to compare values, such as equality, inequality, greater than, and less than. Examples of comparison operators include <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Logical operators</strong>: These are used to perform logical operations, such as AND, OR, and NOT. Examples of logical operators include <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, and <code>!</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.5 Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In this chapter, we have covered the basic syntax and data types of a programming language. Understanding the syntax and data types is crucial for writing efficient and effective code. We have also introduced variables and operators, which are used to store and manipulate values in a program. In the next chapter, we will cover control structures, which are used to control the flow of a program.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Write a program that declares a variable <code>x</code> of type <code>int</code> and assigns it the value <code>5</code>.</li>
<li>Write a program that declares a variable <code>y</code> of type <code>float</code> and assigns it the value <code>3.14</code>.</li>
<li>Write a program that declares a variable <code>z</code> of type <code>bool</code> and assigns it the value <code>true</code>.</li>
<li>Write a program that uses the arithmetic operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code> to perform calculations.</li>
<li>Write a program that uses the comparison operators <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;</code> to compare values.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Answer Key</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><code>int x = 5;</code></li>
<li><code>float y = 3.14;</code></li>
<li><code>bool z = true;</code></li>
<li><code>int result = 5 + 3 * 2;</code></li>
<li><code>if (x == 5) { cout &lt;&lt; "x is equal to 5"; }</code></li>
</ol>

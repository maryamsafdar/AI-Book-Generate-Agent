<p><strong>Chapter 10.3: Methods and Inheritance</strong></p>

<p>In object-oriented programming, methods and inheritance are two fundamental concepts that enable developers to create robust, reusable, and maintainable code. In this chapter, we will delve into the world of methods and inheritance, exploring their definitions, syntax, and applications.</p>

<p><strong>10.3.1: Methods</strong></p>

<p>A method is a block of code that is associated with an object or a class. It is a way to perform a specific action or set of actions on an object or a class. Methods can take arguments, perform calculations, and return values. In object-oriented programming, methods are used to define the behavior of an object or a class.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Methods</strong></p>

<p>There are two types of methods: instance methods and class methods.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Instance Methods</strong>: These methods are associated with an instance of a class. They have access to the instance's attributes and can modify them. Instance methods are used to perform actions that are specific to an instance of a class.</li>
<li><strong>Class Methods</strong>: These methods are associated with a class itself, rather than an instance of the class. They have access to the class's attributes and can modify them. Class methods are used to perform actions that are common to all instances of a class.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method Syntax</strong></p>

<p>The syntax for defining a method in a class is as follows:</p>

<p><code>python
class ClassName:
    def methodName(self, arguments):
        # method body
</code></p>

<p>In this syntax, <code>ClassName</code> is the name of the class, <code>methodName</code> is the name of the method, and <code>arguments</code> are the parameters that the method takes.</p>

<p><strong>10.3.2: Inheritance</strong></p>

<p>Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the parent class or superclass, while the class that is doing the inheriting is called the child class or subclass.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Inheritance</strong></p>

<p>There are three types of inheritance: single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and multilevel inheritance.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Single Inheritance</strong>: In single inheritance, a child class inherits from a single parent class.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Inheritance</strong>: In multiple inheritance, a child class inherits from multiple parent classes.</li>
<li><strong>Multilevel Inheritance</strong>: In multilevel inheritance, a child class inherits from a parent class, which in turn inherits from another parent class.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inheritance Syntax</strong></p>

<p>The syntax for inheriting from a parent class in Python is as follows:</p>

<p><code>python
class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    # child class body
</code></p>

<p>In this syntax, <code>ChildClass</code> is the name of the child class, and <code>ParentClass</code> is the name of the parent class.</p>

<p><strong>Method Overriding</strong></p>

<p>Method overriding is a feature of inheritance that allows a child class to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The child class's method has the same name, return type, and parameter list as the parent class's method, but it can have a different implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Method Overloading</strong></p>

<p>Method overloading is a feature of some programming languages that allows multiple methods with the same name to be defined, as long as they have different parameter lists. However, Python does not support method overloading in the classical sense. Instead, it uses a feature called "duck typing" to achieve similar results.</p>

<p><strong>Example Code</strong></p>

<p>Here is an example of a parent class and a child class in Python:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Parent class</h1>

<p>class Animal:
    def <strong>init</strong>(self, name):
        self.name = name</p>

<pre><code>def speak(self):
    print("The animal makes a sound.")
</code></pre>

<h1>Child class</h1>

<p>class Dog(Animal):
    def <strong>init</strong>(self, name, breed):
        super().<strong>init</strong>(name)
        self.breed = breed</p>

<pre><code>def speak(self):
    print("The dog barks.")
</code></pre>

<h1>Create an instance of the Dog class</h1>

<p>my_dog = Dog("Fido", "Golden Retriever")</p>

<h1>Call the speak method</h1>

<p>my_dog.speak()
```</p>

<p>In this example, the <code>Dog</code> class inherits from the <code>Animal</code> class and overrides the <code>speak</code> method. When we create an instance of the <code>Dog</code> class and call the <code>speak</code> method, it prints "The dog barks."</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In this chapter, we explored the concepts of methods and inheritance in object-oriented programming. We learned about the different types of methods, including instance methods and class methods, and how to define them in a class. We also learned about the different types of inheritance, including single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and multilevel inheritance, and how to use them to create a hierarchy of classes. Finally, we saw an example of how to use method overriding to provide a different implementation of a method in a child class.</p>

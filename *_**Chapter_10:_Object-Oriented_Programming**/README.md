<p><strong>Chapter 10: Object-Oriented Programming</strong></p>

<p><strong>10.1 Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects and classes. It is a way of designing and organizing code that simulates real-world objects and systems. OOP is based on the idea of encapsulating data and behavior into a single unit, called an object, which can be manipulated and interacted with.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. We will also discuss the benefits and advantages of using OOP in software development.</p>

<p><strong>10.2 Classes and Objects</strong></p>

<p>In OOP, a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the properties and behavior of an object. A class is essentially a design pattern or a template that defines the characteristics of an object. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class, and it has its own set of attributes (data) and methods (functions).</p>

<p>For example, consider a class called "Car" that has attributes such as "color," "make," and "model," and methods such as "startEngine()" and "accelerate()". An object of the "Car" class would be a specific instance of a car, such as a "Toyota Camry" with a "red" color.</p>

<p><strong>10.3 Inheritance</strong></p>

<p>Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The child class inherits all the attributes and methods of the parent class and can also add new attributes and methods or override the ones inherited from the parent class.</p>

<p>For example, consider a class called "Vehicle" that has attributes such as "color" and "make," and methods such as "startEngine()". A class called "Car" can inherit from the "Vehicle" class and add new attributes such as "model" and methods such as "accelerate()".</p>

<p><strong>10.4 Polymorphism</strong></p>

<p>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding or method overloading. Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. Method overloading occurs when multiple methods with the same name can be defined, but with different parameters.</p>

<p>For example, consider a class called "Shape" that has a method called "area()". A class called "Circle" can override the "area()" method to provide a different implementation that is specific to circles.</p>

<p><strong>10.5 Encapsulation</strong></p>

<p>Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world and only exposing the necessary information through public methods. This helps to protect the internal state of an object from external interference and misuse.</p>

<p>For example, consider a class called "BankAccount" that has attributes such as "balance" and "accountNumber". The "balance" attribute can be encapsulated by providing public methods such as "deposit()" and "withdraw()" that allow users to interact with the account balance without directly accessing the attribute.</p>

<p><strong>10.6 Abstraction</strong></p>

<p>Abstraction is the concept of showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the internal details. Abstraction helps to reduce complexity and improve modularity in software design.</p>

<p>For example, consider a class called "Calculator" that provides methods such as "add()" and "subtract()". The internal implementation of these methods can be abstracted away from the user, who only needs to know how to use the methods without worrying about the internal details.</p>

<p><strong>10.7 Benefits of OOP</strong></p>

<p>OOP provides several benefits, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Modularity</strong>: OOP allows for modular code that is easy to maintain and extend.</li>
<li><strong>Reusability</strong>: OOP enables code reusability through inheritance and polymorphism.</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: OOP helps to abstract away complex details and provide a simpler interface to users.</li>
<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: OOP provides encapsulation, which helps to protect the internal state of an object from external interference.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>10.8 Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In this chapter, we explored the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. We also discussed the benefits and advantages of using OOP in software development. By applying the principles of OOP, developers can create modular, reusable, and maintainable code that is easier to understand and extend.</p>

<p><strong>10.9 Exercises</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Create a class called "Person" with attributes such as "name" and "age", and methods such as "greet()".</li>
<li>Create a class called "Student" that inherits from the "Person" class and adds new attributes such as "studentId" and methods such as "enroll()".</li>
<li>Create a class called "Shape" with a method called "area()". Create subclasses such as "Circle" and "Rectangle" that override the "area()" method.</li>
<li>Create a class called "BankAccount" with attributes such as "balance" and "accountNumber". Provide public methods such as "deposit()" and "withdraw()" to interact with the account balance.</li>

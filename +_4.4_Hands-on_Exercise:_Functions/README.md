<p><strong>Chapter 4.4: Hands-on Exercise - Functions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In the previous chapters, we have discussed the basics of programming and how to write efficient code. In this chapter, we will dive deeper into the world of functions, which are a crucial part of any programming language. Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task, making your code more modular, readable, and maintainable. In this hands-on exercise, we will explore how to create and use functions in your programs.</p>

<p><strong>What are Functions?</strong></p>

<p>A function is a block of code that can be called multiple times from different parts of your program. It takes in arguments, performs a specific task, and returns a value. Functions are useful for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Code Reusability</strong>: Functions allow you to write code once and use it multiple times in your program.</li>
<li><strong>Modularity</strong>: Functions break down your code into smaller, manageable blocks, making it easier to understand and maintain.</li>
<li><strong>Readability</strong>: Functions make your code more readable by giving a name to a block of code that performs a specific task.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Creating a Function</strong></p>

<p>To create a function, you need to define it using the <code>def</code> keyword followed by the function name and a list of arguments in parentheses. The code block inside the function is indented using four spaces.</p>

<p>```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")</p>

<p>greet("John")  # Output: Hello, John!
```</p>

<p>In this example, we define a function called <code>greet</code> that takes a <code>name</code> argument and prints out a greeting message. We then call the function by passing the argument <code>"John"</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Function Arguments</strong></p>

<p>Functions can take multiple arguments, which are values passed to the function when it is called. You can define a function with multiple arguments by separating them with commas.</p>

<p>```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y</p>

<p>result = add(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```</p>

<p>In this example, we define a function called <code>add</code> that takes two arguments <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> and returns their sum. We then call the function by passing the arguments <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Function Return Values</strong></p>

<p>Functions can return values using the <code>return</code> statement. The return value is the result of the function's execution.</p>

<p>```python
def square(x):
    return x * x</p>

<p>result = square(4)
print(result)  # Output: 16
```</p>

<p>In this example, we define a function called <code>square</code> that takes an argument <code>x</code> and returns its square. We then call the function by passing the argument <code>4</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Function Scope</strong></p>

<p>Functions have their own scope, which means that variables defined inside a function are not accessible outside the function.</p>

<p>```python
def greet(name):
    message = "Hello, " + name + "!"
    print(message)</p>

<p>greet("John")  # Output: Hello, John!
print(message)  # Error: message is not defined
```</p>

<p>In this example, we define a function called <code>greet</code> that defines a variable <code>message</code> inside the function. We then try to access the variable outside the function, which results in an error.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Now that you have learned about functions, it's time to practice. Create a function called <code>calculate_area</code> that takes two arguments <code>length</code> and <code>width</code> and returns the area of a rectangle. Then, call the function by passing the arguments <code>5</code> and <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length * width</p>

<p>result = calculate_area(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 15
```</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In this chapter, we have learned about functions and how to create and use them in your programs. Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task, making your code more modular, readable, and maintainable. We have also learned about function arguments, return values, and scope. With practice and experience, you will become proficient in using functions to write efficient and effective code.</p>
